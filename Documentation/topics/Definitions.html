    		<h1> LSystem Engine File Structure</h1>
    		<h2>General File Rules</h2>
    		<p>The LSystem Engine file specification was intended to be simple and use as few control characters as possible.  LSystem definitions are stored in a file with the extension ".lsf".
    			  Definition files are read on a line by line basis with statements and their arguments delimited by ':' (colon) characters.    Multiple LSystems can be defined in one file.
    			  Comments are allowed in definition files: any line starting with "#" is ignored during parsing.  Comments ("#") can also appear at the end of a line, but not within any statement.  
    			  Please see the provided example LSystem files for further reference.
    		</p>
    		
    	</div>
    	
    	<div>
    		
    		<h2> Statements </h2>
    		
    		<p>
    			An LSystem file is composed of statements.  Statements are declared at the begining of a line and are followed by their arguments.
    			The first statement will always be to declare an LSystem with the "lsystem" statement followed by a semi-colon ":" and a user specified name.
    			By convention, statements are declared in the order listed in this document.  Statements can appear in any order under an opening "lsystem" statement.  
    			An important rule to note with the "production" statement is that the order in which productions are declared, are the order in which they are applied.  
    			Not all statements need to be included in a definition for that definition to be valid.   All LSystem definitions need an "axiom" and at least one "alias" in order to be valid.
    			To define multiple LSystems, simply use the "lsystem" statement to begin defining a new LSystem.

    			Groups are a series of lettters with a key letter.  The letters specified in a group must be defined as a Group, Alias, or a SubSystem. 
    			You may reference other groups from within a group, allowing for nested execution of groups.
    			They are designed as a mechanism to combine multiple Turtle instructions into a single letter.    
    			Instead of having to repeat series of Turtle instructions to describe a compound action a group can be defined.

    		<p>
    			Aliases are a feature of this implementation of an LSystem and are not described in ABOP.  
    			Aliases are used to execute commands in a Turtle.  Instead using letters as direct Turtle functions, aliases define letters over explicit Turtle commands.  
    			It's import to note that a special key word: "null" may be used as a Turtle command.   
    			This creates a "null" alias that is intercepted by the resolver and not called as a command on the turtle.
    			This implements the functionality described on page 16 of ABOP where the Turtle ignores letters.
